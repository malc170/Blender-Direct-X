# Blender-Direct-X
I Have Update Chris Foster to work on Blender 2.80. 

The python source code is all Chris Foster work and i take no credit for it, All I have done is change a smill bit of the python code so it will work on 2.80.

It should work the same has the older version and all the documents for that should still apply.

Please check out the old version here where you will any document that go with it.
